# Spotter Takehome Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains a take-home assessment demonstrating my knowledge of **PySpark** and **Databricks**.

## How to Use

- Open the notebook titled `Sr DE Assessment.ipynb`.
- You can read through the notebook without running it ‚Äî it contains PySpark code that will execute in any Databricks cluster.
- The notebook includes both the questions and the corresponding code.

## Notes

- If you're using an IDE with GitHub Copilot or another LLM, feel free to use it to help understand the code.
- The notebook showcases optimizations applied both in the PySpark logic and through Databricks runtime configuration settings.

## Try It Yourself

If you're interested in running the code:
- You can sign up for the **Databricks Community Edition**.
- Upload the `.ipynb` file and run it directly in a Databricks notebook.
- This is a great hands-on challenge to learn how to work with Spark on Databricks.
