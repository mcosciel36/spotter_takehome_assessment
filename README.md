## Just click on the Sr DE Assessment.ipynb 
## You can read through it.  It's pyspark code that will run in any databricks cluster.   There's no need to run it.  You can see the questions, the code and the generated results.   This is just an example of my knowledge of pyspark and databricks.   The questions are challenging.   

## If you're interested to try yourself; You can sign up for the community eddition of databricks, upload the .ipynb and run the code in databricks.   This is a good challenge to learn how to code in spark on top of databricks.
